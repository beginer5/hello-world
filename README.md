# hello-world
lesson in trying to figure out what I signed up for
I have no clue what i'm doing. I think I get it,for about minute then I have no friggin clue if I did something completely wrong or just have a typo. Mentioned I'm lost?  Also a little red-faced that it took some time to find the commit changes button.  Also thought I was looking to comment changes....probably should learn to read before attempt learning to code
